# This file specifies an INTERFACE library, allowing you to include Asap in your CMake project.
# To use Asap in your project, put this folder under your source dir and use `add_subdirectory(asap)`. For every
# target that uses asap, a simple `target_link_libraries(target asap)` is sufficient to set up include and link
# instructions.
